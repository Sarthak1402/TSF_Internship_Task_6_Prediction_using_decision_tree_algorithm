# TSF_Internship_Task_6_Prediction_using_decision_tree_algorithm
This is the project I did as part of my internship in The Spark Foundation on September 2023. The project is about creating a decision tree classifier for prediction purposes. This project uses the iris.csv dataset and deals with the classifiaction problem of the specific series using explanatory data analysis and machine learning.
